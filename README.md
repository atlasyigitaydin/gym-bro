# GymBro 🏋️‍♂️💪

GymBro is a simple and fun workout tracking app for those who wonder, "What exercises should I do today?" Right now, I'm building it just for myself and my friends, but who knows? If people like it, maybe I'll launch it for everyone! 🤷‍♂️

## 🚀 Current Status
No App Store adventure yet! This is just a project to track our own workout routines. A fun little thing. But hey, if you like it, let me know—we might take it further. 😎

## 📌 Features
- **Muscle Groups**: Biceps, triceps, back, chest, abs, shoulders, and legs. (No more wondering, "What should I train today?")
- **Create Your Own Routine**: Pick a 3-day workout plan and never forget!
- **React Native & Expo**: Built with Expo for easy mobile usage.
- **Gluestack v2 UI**: Used a cool UI library to make it look sleek.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **React Native** (Runs on Expo)
- **TypeScript** (Because, of course, I won't write typeless code)
- **Gluestack v2** (Because nice buttons matter!)

## 📦 How to Use
If you want to try it out, here’s how to run it:

1. **Clone the project:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/username/gymbro.git
   cd gymbro
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the app:**
   ```sh
   npx expo start
   ```

## 🎯 Future Plans
- **Widget Support**: I plan to add a widget so you can quickly check your routine from the home screen.
- **Advanced Workout Tracking**: Maybe a more detailed tracking system in the future. (Who knows? 😉)

## 🤝 Contributions
This is just a fun project! But if you have any ideas, feel free to share. We might improve it together. 😁
